# Ikman.lk Clone - Experimental UI Recreation
This is a clone of the ikman.lk user interface (UI) layout and design, created by Yasith Perera for experimental purposes.

Note: This is not an official ikman.lk product and is not intended for public use.

## Functionality:

This is a UI mockup only. Search functionality and links are implemented redirecting to the original website. Clicking on any link will redirect you to the original ikman.lk website.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/yasithperera/ikman.lk-clone.git.
Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed (e.g., Node.js, npm).

### Installation:

Navigate to the project directory: cd ikman.lk-clone
Install dependencies: npm install (or yarn install if using yarn)

### Development:

Code for the project is located within the src directory.
You can start a development server using npm start (or yarn start), which will typically run the application on http://localhost:3000 by default (you can check the package.json for specific configuration).
Edit the code and refresh the browser to see the changes.

## Disclaimer:

This is a work in progress and may not be a perfect replica of the original ikman.lk UI.
The code might not follow best practices or industry standards as it serves as an experimental project.

## Further Exploration:

This project serves as a starting point for exploring UI design principles and web development concepts.
Feel free to modify the code to improve the UI layout or experiment with adding new features like basic search functionality.
